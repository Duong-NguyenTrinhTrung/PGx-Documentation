Targets
======================

The ‘Target browser’ page at https://pgx-db.org/target_lookup is designed to show all the collected drug targets. In this page you will find:

1.  A search box as the top to enable searching any target by *UniProt accession number*, *protein name*, *gene name* or *Ensembl gene ID*. Our autocomplete feature suggests possible matches as you type.

2.  In each row showing basic target information, you can see links to a specific each for each target as well as a list of all drugs interacting with this target
