**1. What are ATC codes?**

*ATC codes, or Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System codes, are a system used for the classification of drugs and medicines. The system is organized into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and their therapeutic, pharmacological, and chemical properties. It is used internationally for the classification of medication and serves several purposes, such as facilitating health care professionals' search for specific drugs, aiding in the organization and analysis of drug utilization and research data, and supporting health care policy and management decisions.

The ATC classification system divides drugs into different groups at five different levels:

1st level (Anatomical main group): The drugs are divided into groups according to the organ or system on which they act, indicated by one letter (e.g., "A" for Alimentary tract and metabolism).

2nd level (Therapeutic main group): Two digits follow the letter, indicating the main therapeutic group of drugs.

3rd level (Therapeutic/pharmacological subgroup): One letter is added to specify the therapeutic or pharmacological subgroup.

4th level (Chemical/therapeutic/pharmacological subgroup): An additional letter is used to identify the chemical, therapeutic, or pharmacological subgroup within the main group.

5th level (Chemical substance): The final level specifies the chemical substance, denoted by two digits.

For example, the ATC code for Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is N02BE01, where:

N indicates it is a Nervous system drug,
02 denotes it is an analgesic,
BE specifies it is an anilide,
01 identifies it as Paracetamol.
This systematic coding helps in ensuring uniform classification and usage of drugs across different countries and regions, facilitating international communication about drug use and research.*
