Variants
==================================================================================

The variant page is designed to showcase all variants occurring on collected targets/genes, along with their effect prediction scores and association summary statistics. On this page, you will find:

A search box at the top that enables the search for a variant by its identifier (in the format: **Chromosome_Coordinate_Reference/Alternative allele**). Our autocomplete feature suggests possible matches as you type.

Each row in the results box provides fundamental information about the gene where the variant occurs, along with a link to a specific page for that gene. On this gene detail page, you will find:

a. Detailed annotations for all variants of this gene, which allows for the search of any variant.
b. A collection of 40 variant effect prediction scores, displayed in a color-coded manner to easily understand the magnitude of the effect.
c. A mean value of the 40 scores and a box plot that summarizes the range of these scores.
d. A link to the association summary statistics for the selected variant.
