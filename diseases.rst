Diseases
==============

The ‘Disease browser’ page at https://pgx-db.org/disease-lookup is designed to display all collected diseases and corresponding drug-disease association studies. On this page, you will find:

1/ A search box at the top that enables searching for a disease by its name. Our autocomplete feature suggests possible matches as the user types.

2/ Each row in the results box provides basic disease information, a list of drugs whose associations with the disease have been studied and the phase of the trial they are in, and a link to tripartite network visualizations for drugs, targets, and disease nodes.
