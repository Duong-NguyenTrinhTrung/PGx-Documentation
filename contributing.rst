Contributing to the project
===========================

We welcome all contributions to the project. If you have an idea for a feature you would like to implement,
improvements to make, or data to add/update, please ....

As a programmer
---------------

We use languages/tools such as Python, Javascript, Django, PostgreSQL, and Git to build PGx. Prior knowledge of
these tools is helpful, but not necessary.

As a data curator
-----------------

Data curation tasks involve e.g. collection of variant data, variant-based or gene-based association burden test, variant effect prediction scores.
