Graphical overview
==============

Our resource provides a comprehensive overview of diverse data types,  serving as a centralized hub for pharmacogenomics data search and browsing. The integrated data encompasses drug, disease, target, corresponding genes as well as their variants. In addition, it is important to know the effects of variants in different aspects. We therefore also collected variant effect prediction (VEP) scores, gene-based association summary statistics, and pharmacogenomics data. Apart from the 4 basic entities drug, diease, target and variant mentioned above, their relationships (interactions, associations, adverse reaction, variants affecting drug responses) are also collected and organized based on Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical property classification of drugs).
