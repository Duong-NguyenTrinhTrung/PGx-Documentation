Ligand coverage
---------------

The ligand coverage page is designed to showcase the ligand data present in GPCRdb through a fast visualization tree
able to convey the message in a timely fashion. In this page you will find:

1.  A table at the top, listing the number of unique ligands per receptor class, divided by each class (family).
    Moreover, the table lists also the average number of ligands per GPCR in each class and the total count.
    Lastly, the table lists the number of GPCRs with ligands for each class present in GPCRdb.
2.  Visualization phylogenetic trees for each GPCR class, where each branch points to a different ligand family,
    ending with an inner circle shaded by the amount of ligand data available for that specific GPCR receptor.
    Coloring of that inner circle is in grayscale, whereas light shades of gray may vary between 10 to 500
    ligands, and darker shades of grey up to black add up to more than 1000 compounds targeting that receptor.

Phylogenetic trees be default will show the UniProt name of the different GPCRs, but through a dedicated selection
button users can decide to show the IUPHAR names of those GPCRs. Trees can also be downloaded in several different
formats (SVG, JPG, TIFF and PNG), allowing for high resolution figures for publication purposes.

Ligands (ChEMBL, GtP, Ki db)
------------------

The ligand query section provides two different alternatives for investigating the ligands available in GPCRdb:

1.  Querying by receptor
2.  Querying by ligand name, ligand ID, SMILES or Inchikey.
